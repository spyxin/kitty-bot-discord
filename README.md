# kitty-bot-discord
trying to clean it up and make it break less aaa
<br>
how does one sync this stuff so the commands work outside of my chosen server QnQ
<br>
just adding the code for it here aaa (except the important ones ouo)

<br>
<br>

## commands that work:
.kitty - bot says meow and mentions ur user :] <br>
.sendembed - sends a simple embed about itself <br>
any of the moderation ones and report <br>
/attack - has the kitty a specified user or urself

<br>
<br>

## commands that don't work rn:
/animals - pick ur fav animal <br>
/vibes - kitty gives u a vibe check <br>
/meow - click the button to meow (counter)

<br>
<br>

## why have i created it?
i just wanted to have my own lil bot, plus it's a way for me to learn python ig xD
<br>
it's pretty simple rn but i'm hoping to add more in the future :,]
